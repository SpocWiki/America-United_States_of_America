## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is the domestic intelligence 
> and security service of the United States and its principal federal law enforcement agency. 
> 
> An agency of the United States Department of Justice, 
> the FBI is a member of the U.S. Intelligence Community 
> and reports to both the attorney general and the director of national intelligence. 
> 
> A leading American counterterrorism, counterintelligence, and criminal investigative organization, 
> the FBI has jurisdiction over violations of more than 200 categories of federal crimes.  
> The FBI maintains a list of its top 10 most wanted fugitives.
>
> Although many of the FBI's functions are unique, 
> its activities in support of national security are comparable to those of the British MI5 and NCA, 
> the New Zealand GCSB and the Russian FSB. 
> 
> Unlike the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), which has no law enforcement authority 
> and is focused on intelligence collection abroad, the FBI is primarily a domestic agency, 
> maintaining 56 field offices in major cities throughout the United States, 
> and more than 400 resident agencies in smaller cities and areas across the nation. 
> At an FBI field office, 
> a senior-level FBI officer concurrently serves as the representative of the director of national intelligence.
>
> Despite its domestic focus, the FBI also maintains a significant international footprint, 
> operating 60 Legal Attache (LEGAT) offices 
> and 15 sub-offices in U.S. embassies and consulates across the globe. 
> These foreign offices exist primarily for the purpose of coordination with foreign security services 
> and do not usually conduct unilateral operations in the host countries. 
> 
> The FBI can and does at times carry out secret activities overseas, 
> just as the CIA has a limited domestic function. 
> These activities generally require coordination across government agencies.
>
> The FBI was established in 1908 as the Bureau of Investigation, the BOI or BI for short. 
> Its name was changed to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in 1935. 
> The FBI headquarters is the J. Edgar Hoover Building in Washington, D.C.
