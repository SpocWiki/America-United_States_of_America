> The Lewis and Clark Expedition, also known as the Corps of Discovery Expedition, 
> was the United States expedition to cross the newly acquired western portion of the country 
> **after the Louisiana Purchase**. 
> 
> The Corps of Discovery was a select group of U.S. Army and civilian volunteers 
> under the command of Captain Meriwether Lewis 
> and his close friend Second Lieutenant William Clark. 
> 
> Clark, along with 30 others, set out from Camp Dubois (Camp Wood), Illinois, 
> on May 14, 1804, met Lewis and ten other members of the group in St. Charles, Missouri, 
> then went up the Missouri River. 
> 
> The expedition crossed the Continental Divide of the Americas near the Lemhi Pass, 
> eventually coming to the Columbia River, and the Pacific Ocean in 1805. 
> The return voyage began on March 23, 1806, at Fort Clatsop, Oregon, 
> ending six months later on September 23 of that year.
>
> President Thomas Jefferson commissioned the expedition, 
> shortly after the Louisiana Purchase of 1803, 
> to explore and detail as much of the new territory as possible. 
> Furthermore, he wished to find a practical travel route across the western half of the continent
> —directly avoiding the hot and desolate desert southwest—
> and to establish an American presence in the new lands 
> before European powers attempted to establish claims of their own. 
> 
> The campaign's secondary objectives were scientific, economical and humanitarian, 
> i.e., to document the West's biodiversity, topography and geography 
> and to establish positive trade relations with (potentially unknown) Native American tribes. 
> 
> The expedition returned to St. Louis to report their findings to President Jefferson 
> via maps, sketches, and various journals.
