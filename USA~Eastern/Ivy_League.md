## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The Ivy League is an American collegiate athletic conference 
> of eight private research universities in the Northeastern United States. 
> 
> It participates in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I, 
> and in football, in the Football Championship Subdivision (FCS). 
> 
> The term Ivy League is used more broadly to refer to the eight schools 
> that belong to the league, which are globally renowned as elite colleges 
> associated with academic excellence, highly selective admissions, and social elitism. 
> 
> The term was used as early as 1933, and it became official in 1954 
> following the formation of the Ivy League athletic conference. 
> At times, they have also been referred to as the "Ancient Eight".
>
> The eight members of the Ivy League are 
> - Cornell University, 
> - Brown University, 
> - Columbia University, 
> - Dartmouth College, 
> - Harvard University, 
> - University of Pennsylvania, 
> - Princeton University, and 
> - Yale University. 
> 
> The conference headquarters is in Princeton, New Jersey. 
> All of the "Ivies" except Cornell were founded during the colonial period 
> and therefore make up seven of the nine colonial colleges. 
> 
> The other two colonial colleges, Queen's College (now Rutgers University) 
> and the College of William & Mary, became public institutions.
