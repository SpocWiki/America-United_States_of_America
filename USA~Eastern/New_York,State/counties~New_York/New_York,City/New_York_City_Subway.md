> The New York City Subway is a rapid transit system in New York City, 
> serving four of the city's five boroughs: Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx. 
> 
> It is owned by the government of New York City and leased to the New York City Transit Authority, an affiliate agency of the state-run Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA). Opened on October 27, 1904, the New York City Subway is one of the world's oldest public transit systems, one of the most-used, and the one with the second-most stations after the Beijing Subway, with 472 stations in operation (423, if stations connected by transfers are counted as single stations).
>
> The system has operated 24/7 service every day of the year throughout most of its history, barring emergencies and disasters. By annual ridership, the New York City Subway is the busiest rapid transit system in both the Western Hemisphere and the Western world, as well as the ninth-busiest rapid transit rail system in the world. The subway carried 2,040,132,000 unlinked, non-unique riders in 2024. Daily ridership has been calculated since 1985; the record, over 6.2 million, was set on October 29, 2015.
>
> The system is also one of the world's longest. Overall, the system consists of 248 miles (399 km) of routes, comprising a total of 665 miles (1,070 km) of revenue track and a total of 850 miles (1,370 km) including non-revenue trackage. Of the system's 28 routes or "services" (which usually share track or "lines" with other services), 25 pass through Manhattan, the exceptions being the G train, the Franklin Avenue Shuttle, and the Rockaway Park Shuttle. Large portions of the subway outside Manhattan are elevated, on embankments, or in open cuts, and a few stretches of track run at ground level; 40% of track is above ground. Many lines and stations have both express and local services. These lines have three or four tracks. Normally, the outer two are used by local trains, while the inner one or two are used by express trains.
>
> As of 2018, the New York City Subway's budgetary burden for expenditures was $8.7 billion, supported by collection of fares, bridge tolls, and earmarked regional taxes and fees, as well as direct funding from state and local governments.
