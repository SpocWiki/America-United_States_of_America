> Bryce Canyon National Park is a national park of the United States located in southwestern Utah. 
> The major feature of the park is Bryce Canyon, which despite its name, 
> is not a canyon but a collection of giant natural amphitheaters 
> along the eastern side of the Paunsaugunt Plateau. 
> 
> Bryce is distinctive due to geological structures called hoodoos, 
> formed by frost weathering and stream erosion of the river and lake bed sedimentary rock. 
> The red, orange, and white colors of the rocks provide spectacular views for park visitors. 
> Bryce Canyon National Park is much smaller 
> and sits at a much higher elevation than nearby Zion National Park. 
> The rim at Bryce varies from 8,000 to 9,000 feet (2,400 to 2,700 m).
>
> The area is in portions of Garfield County and Kane County.
>
> The Bryce Canyon area was settled by Mormon pioneers in the 1850s 
> and was named after Ebenezer Bryce, who homesteaded in the area in 1874. 
> The area was originally designated as a national monument by President Warren G. Harding in 1923 
> and was redesignated as a national park by Congress in 1928. 
> 
> The park covers 35,835 acres (55.992 sq mi; 14,502 ha; 145.02 km2) 
> and receives substantially fewer visitors than Zion National Park (nearly 4.3 million in 2016) 
> or Grand Canyon National Park (almost 6 million in 2016), 
> largely due to Bryce's more remote location. 
> In 2023, Bryce Canyon received 2,461,269 visitors.
