## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The Mauna Kea Observatories (MKO) are a group of independent astronomical research facilities 
> and large telescope observatories that are located at the summit of Mauna Kea on  HawaiÊ»i. 
> 
> The facilities are located in a 525-acre (212 ha) special land use zone 
> known as the "Astronomy Precinct", 
> which is located within the 11,228-acre (4,544 ha) Mauna Kea Science Reserve. 
> 
> The Astronomy Precinct was established in 1967 and is located on land 
> protected by the Historical Preservation Act for its significance to Hawaiian culture. 
> The presence and continued construction of telescopes is highly controversial 
> due to Mauna Kea's centrality in native Hawaiian religion and culture, 
> as well as for a variety of environmental reasons.
>
> The location is nearly ideal because of its dark skies from lack of light pollution, 
> good astronomical seeing due to low atmospheric turbulence, low humidity, 
> high elevation of 4,207 m (13,802 ft), position above most of the water vapor in the atmosphere, 
> clean air, low cloud cover and low latitude location.
