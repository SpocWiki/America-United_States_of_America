> The Pacific Coast Ranges (officially gazetted as the Pacific Mountain System in the United States; 
> French: chaînes côtières du Pacifique; Spanish: cadena costera del Pacífico) 
> are the series of mountain ranges that stretch along the West Coast of North America 
> from Alaska south to northern and central Mexico. 
> 
> Although they are commonly thought to be the westernmost mountain range 
> of the continental United States and Canada, 
> the geologically distinct Insular Mountains of Vancouver Island lie farther west.
>
> The Pacific Coast Ranges are part of the North American Cordillera 
> (sometimes known as the Western Cordillera, or in Canada, as the Pacific Cordillera 
> and/or the Canadian Cordillera), which includes the Rocky Mountains, the Columbia Mountains, the Interior Mountains, the Interior Plateau, the Sierra Nevada, the Great Basin mountain ranges, 
> and other ranges and various plateaus and basins.
>
> The Pacific Coast Ranges designation, however, 
> only applies to the Western System of the Western Cordillera, 
> which comprises the Saint Elias Mountains, Coast Mountains, Insular Mountains, Olympic Mountains, Cascade Range, Oregon Coast Range, California Coast Ranges, Transverse Ranges, Peninsular Ranges, and the Sierra Madre Occidental.
